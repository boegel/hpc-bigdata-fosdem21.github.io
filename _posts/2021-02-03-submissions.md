We invite presenters to submit talk proposals to present high-quality work with sufficient background
material to be clear to the HPC, Big Data, and/or Data Science communities.
Talk proposals should be submitted through the [FOSDEM Pentabarf
server](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM20).
<!--Talk proposals should be submitted through the [FOSDEM Pentabarf

Submissions must include:

- Abstract (plain text, couple of paragraps)
- Session type
- Session length
- Expected prior knowledge / intended audience
- Speaker bio
- Links to code / slides / material for the talk (optional)

Our intention is to have a full day of talks of about 20 minutes each, with an additional 5-10 minutes for questions by attendees.

We would also like to note:

- All accepted talks will be about (using) free and open source software.<br/>We highly discourage "marketing" talks.
- Due to the online format, <strong>presentations will have to be pre-recorded.</strong>
- Final presentations, including recording, will be <strong>due by mid January 2021</strong>.
- Talks will be streamed at the planned time slot on Sunday February 7th 2021.
- <strong>Speakers are expected to join their session for live Q&A with attendees after the talk.</strong>
