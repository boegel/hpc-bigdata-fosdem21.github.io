We invite presenters to submit talk proposals to present high-quality work with sufficient background
material to be clear to the HPC, Big Data, and/or Data Science communities.
Talk proposals should be submitted through the [FOSDEM Pentabarf
server](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM18). Submissions must include:

- Abstract
- Session type
- Session length
- Expected prior knowledge / intended audience
- Speaker bio
- Links to code / slides / material for the talk (optional)
- Links to previous talks by the speaker

Our intention is to have a full day of talks of about 20 minutes each, with an additional 5 minutes for questions by attendees.

We would also like to note: 

- Talks will be streamed live and will be recorded. By submitting a session, speakers agree to being recorded and having their talk made available.
- All accepted talks will be about (using) free and open source software. We highly discourage "marketing" talks.
