We invite presenters to submit high-quality work with sufficient background
material to be clear to the HPC, Big Data, and/or Data Science communities.
Talks proposals should be submitted through the [FOSDEM Pentabarf
server](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM16). Submissions should include:

- Abstract
- Session type
- Session length
- Participants prior knowledge required / intended audience
- Speaker bio
- Links to code / slides / material for the talk (optional)
- Links to previous talks by the speaker

We would also like to note: 

- Talks will be streamed live and will be recorded. By submitting a session, speakers agree to being recorded and having their talk made available.
- All accepted talks will be about free and open source software. We highly discourage "marketing" talks.

Furthermore, authors must identify any conflict of interest with the Devroom organizers.
