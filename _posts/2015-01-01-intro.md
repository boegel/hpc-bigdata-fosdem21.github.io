### Overview
Welcome to the 1st edition of the HPC, Big Data and Data Science devroom,
co-located with [FOSDEM 2016](https://fosdem.org/2016/). FOSDEM is an annual
conference about free and open source software, attended by over 5000
developers and open-source enthusiasts from all over the world. FOSDEM has
hosted an [HPC devroom
before](https://archive.fosdem.org/2014/schedule/track/hpc_and_computational_science),
but this is the first time that HPC and Big Data open-source enthusiasts are
joining forces to bring the two communities together with this devroom.

- HPC and Big Data are two important approaches to scientific computing. HPC largely focused on the CPU bottlenecks while Big Data largely focuses on the IO bottlenecks. We welcome talks about Free and Open Source solutions to the challenges of large scale scientific computing.

- Free and Open Source communities have been the foundation of the HPC and Big Data communities for some time. In the HPC community, it's no surprise that [488 of the Top500 supercomputers run Linux](http://www.top500.org/statistics/details/osfam/1). On the Big Data side, the Hadoop ecosystem has had a tremendous amount of Open Source contributions from a wide range of organizations coming together under the Apache Software Foundation.

- Our goal is to bring the communities together, share expertise, learn how we
  can benefit from each other's work and foster further joint research and collaboration.

The devroom will take place on Sunday, January 31, at [ULB (Campus Solbosch)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1632534522), in Brussels, Belgium. Join us to enjoy a full day of talks, demos
and interesting discussions on open-source HPC, Big Data and Data Science.
